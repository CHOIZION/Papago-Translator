# Papago-Translator

This code is designed to mimic Papago's translation internals, allowing you to make an unlimited number of translations without an API.

In the ini file, we've set it up to translate English to Korean, but it can translate any other language that Papago supports.

The C# code is the main one, the Python code is a translation of the C# code to Python and should be used separately and can be unstable.
